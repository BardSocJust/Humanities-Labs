These instructions were adapted from Gretta Tritch Roman’s instructions for her course “The Cultural Practice of Mapping”

Download: http://www.bard.edu/pics-backgrounds/back_river_students.jpg

1) Now that you have downloaded the image of Bard, navigate to this file on your computer. Right click on the file (control+click for Macs) and "Open with" Adobe Photoshop.

a. With your photograph open in Photoshop, go to Image > Image Size


b. Note the pixel dimensions - write these down on a piece of paper. You will need them in StoryMap

c. Click Cancel - DO NOT CHANGE any settings here

d. Go to File > Export > Zoomify

f.	A dialogue box will appear with options you will need to change.
The Base Name should be your name without spaces.
Click on the Folder button, choose the location where you will save these. Desktop is fine.
Change the Browser options to be 1000 pixels for both width and height.
Click OK. A zoomable version of your image will open in your browser. Close that tab - you won't need it.


e. Close Adobe Photoshop 

3) Find your Zoomify folder (where you saved it from Photoshop). There will be a folder and a html file that were created. You will just need the folder, which should be named <FirstNameLastName>. In my case it is titled GrettaTritchRoman_img 
a. Inside this folder are other files and folders you will need in StoryMap.



4) Open Google Drive in the Chrome browser (this is important for the functionality of Google Drive): https://drive.google.com
a. Log in with the following credentials:
i. hist2123@gmail.com
ii. photographycourse
b. Drag and drop the folder named <FirstNameLastName> Transferring these
folders will take some time. Please be patient.

5) Once the file is transferred to Google Drive, right click on the file. Choose Share from
the dropdown menu


a. In the Share settings, change to “Anyone on the internet can view and find” Click Done

b. Right click on your folder again. Choose Share again. Copy the link to your clipboard by highlighting it, right clicking and choosing Copy OR by pressing ⌘ Command + C

6) Go to StoryMap JS in your browser: https://storymap.knightlab.com/ And click on the green button that reads Make a storymap now 
a. When it asks “What type of story do you want to create?” Choose Gigapixel b. A dialogue box will appear with some blanks you will need to fill in. 
i. “What do you want to call it?” – the name of your photograph can be whatever you choose; also you can change the name of the photograph later, too
ii. “URL path for your image directory” – this is the link you copied from
Google Drive; paste that URL in this box
iii. “Maximum dimensions of your image” – these are the dimensions
you wrote on a piece of paper when we were using Photoshop; write
the width and the height 


v. Click Create

c. You should now see your map in the upper window with “Slides” to the left. You are currently on your title slide. You can edit the Headline, add a description, etc.

d. We need to credit the image now. In the upper left, choose Options. A dialogue box will appear with the information you already entered to start your project. The last box is Attribution. 

e. Please add the appropriate attribution for your photography
